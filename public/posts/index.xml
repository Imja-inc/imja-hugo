      <description>This is an experiment in how I can have an impact in software engineering best practices, through training and improved tools. There&amp;rsquo;s a few big things in the works, but the idea here is:
 We need to improve cross-team communication to deliver the best software
 Save more time with better software, hacks cost lot more over longer time
 Not everyone will read Fowler and Schneier and follow best practices.</description>
