This is an experiment in how I can have an impact in software engineering best practices, through training and improved tools. There's a few big things in the works, but the idea here is:

- We need to improve cross-team communication to deliver the best software

- Save more time with better software, hacks cost lot more over longer time

- Not everyone will read Fowler and Schneier and follow best practices. How do we train them to do that?

To do this, I'll be doing a few things: writing more, and doing a lot of workshops on the cross-section of -> Security, Leadership skills, Software Engineering. I am by no means an expert but I will be sharing what I learn in this journey.

This is a long bet, and every long bet starts with a failure. I want to fail at the right problems.
